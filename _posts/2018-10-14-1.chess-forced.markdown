# Situation

![situation - white to move]('../../../../../../assets/images/1.png)


# Analysis

White to move.

## first approach

| white | commentary | black | commentary |
| - | - | -| - | 
| `Qg5+` | Kicked myself after realizing the `Bg5+` was better move; rage quit. | | |
| | | | |

Result: Kicked myself

## second approach

| white | commentary | black | commentary |
| - | - | -| - | 
| **Bg5+** | Black king cannot move to `e8` and `f7` beacause of white's queen; cannot move to `d7` and `f7` because of knight; cannot stay in `e7` or move to `f6` because of bishop; his queen and bishop block `d8` and `f8` respectively; only square left to move is `d6`. | **Kd6** | only square left to move to. |
| **Nf7+** | A. Checks, B. threatens queen and rook |  | |
| | | | |

Wait a minute I am an idiot. Just realized that king could have moved to `e6` for better tactical advantage.

Result: Kicked myself

## third approach

| white | commentary | black | commentary |
| - | - | -| - | 
| **Bg5+** | Black king cannot move to `e8` and `f7` beacause of white's queen; cannot move to `d7` and `f7` because of knight; cannot stay in `e7` or move to `f6` because of bishop; his queen and bishop block `d8` and `f8` respectively; only squares left to move are `d6` and `e6`. | **Ke6** | better tactical advantage. |
| **Bxd8** | Capture queen | **be7** | Force invading bishop out. |
| **Bc7** | Protect self, block black squares and protect knight | **pg6** | Block invading queen. |
| | | | |
| | | | |

Well, I cannot keep updating the analysis this way. This is slow and unsustainable.
