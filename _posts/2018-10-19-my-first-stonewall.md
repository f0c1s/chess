## Game

This is a bit staged, as I didn't actually play from black, but just played default suggested move, until black decided to capture.

### FEN

`r1bqk2r/pp3ppp/2nbpn2/2pp4/3P1P2/2PBPN2/PP1N2PP/R1BQK2R b KQkq -`

### PGN

`1. d4 d5 2. e3 e6 3. Bd3 c5 4. c3 Nf6 5. f4 Bd6 6. Nf3 Nc6 7. Nbd2 `

### Suggested next moves

`7... cxd4 8. cxd4 O-O 9. Ne5 Nb4 10. Bb1 b6 11. a3 Na6 12. O-O Nc7 13. Bd3 Ba6 14. Bxa6 Nxa6 15. b3 Rc8 16. Bb2 h6 17. Rc1 Rxc1 18. Qxc1 Qa8 19. Nc6 `


It feels like both the parties mus agree to white's stonewall otherwise it is difficult to setup. In my stonewall, the knights are protecting each other, and knight at d2 is providing extra back up to squares on c4 and e4
