### Right after the game, chat window:

```
KTKing f0c1s is a cheater but lost the match anyways..

f0c1s lel what?

KTKing use a better engine next time bro

MrRembo победааааааа!!!!!

f0c1s read up on london system and fianchetto

f0c1s I am working on my endgames, when I am done, challenge me.

KTKing sure that is why you play arroun 1000 Elo

badbishopjones how do you know if someone cheats. maybe there just good 
    - like me!

f0c1s I am reading up on my openigs. check last 50 games

KTKing maybe he palyed drunk for 50 matches to show what he can really do 
    today maybe, but I dont think so

f0c1s london, fianchetto

f0c1s not good with mid and end

avsaryigit kim

KTKing yeah I know I could have done better but some of your moves are 
    not the once of a 1000er Elo player to be honest

f0c1s dude I read a lot

f0c1s and playing with stockfish 8 offline all the time

KTKing anyways I won but still leves a bad taste in my view

KTKing why is your Elo rating only arround 1000 then?

f0c1s just openings

f0c1s dont be sore winner, crafty but relax

KTKing what?? only working on the openings is useless man

f0c1s its not, there are volumes on openings

KTKing you need to work on all the phases, strange

KTKing anyways excellent opening lay from you but you lost so I suggest 
    you start learning to improvise and use additional tricks then..

f0c1s working on it

KTKing I did not play well but then got angry and wanted to kick your ass 
    was waiting for a mistake and at the very end you provided 2 bad mistakes

f0c1s I know

KTKing my play is excellent some days and lausy on other days and I also 
    read opening move books they are useless the best thing is to only play..

KTKing when you are awake and to use the computer analysis

f0c1s not saving knight was big mistake

KTKing I love chess so I play even when I am tired :-)

f0c1s I mostly read analysis right after game.

KTKing take a look at the end game you should have moved the King out 
    of the way 1st

KTKing anyways now I understand sorry for the cheater line respect for 
    your opening play I can lean from it and will take a look at the computer

KTKing analysis

I think in this day and age, if someone calls you a bot, you probably are doing good. 

### Update: From reddit comment

```

And to think, I didn't even play London or Fianchetto properly in this game. 

I have played better games against ELO 16xx players, 
because I think they practice with bots.

Not to mean that they are bad, it's just I have played a lot of computer than humans.

Examples a: https://lichess.org/MfOQ4TJV/ and b: https://lichess.org/w7Z6YlZo/

How did I end up at London System: 
Well https://lichess.org/@/dimboukosis beat me repeatedly and 
someone mentioned the other day in commandments post 
(though as tongue in cheek fun, but I read up on it). 
And fianchetto, my first reddit post on r/chess .

Anyway, I am going to continue playing LS and FS for a while, 
then I'll incorporate Stonewall and other Queen's Pawn game based attacks.

And oh, to sound even stranger, I am only playing with White if I can help it. 
I have not played Black offline yet. 

I am new and learning chess, 
come beat the shit out of me at: https://lichess.org/@/f0c1s
